            Co-hosts Amira Dhalla and Chad Sansing, along with producers Kristina Gorr and Paul Oh, help participants answer the question, <em>"How can I use the web to teach and learn whatâ€™s important to me?"</em> Join us as we prototype teaching and learning materials live on-air and think out-loud through the curriculum design process.

           Join us for a discussion about the privacy and security as we begin a new quarterly schedule on the Mozilla Curriculum Workshop. What are the privacy and security choices that face youth every day? How can we help them develop the habits they need to keep themselves safe as participants on an open and free internet? How might we contribute to internet health by promoting strong privacy rights for all? Join co-hosts Amira Dhalla and Chad Sansing as they talk and prototype learning materials with Vishal Chavan, Cynthia Lieberman, and Chad Walker.
